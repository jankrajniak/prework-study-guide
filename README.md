# Prework README

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

- The goal of this project was to create a study guide for all UNC Coding bootcamp students. The guide is meant to help them get through the prework
- In the process of building the guide we've covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git, including best practices for Git workflow. These are incidentally the topics covered by the guide.

## Usage

The guide provides notes on 4 topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. Each topic is displayed in it's own section. Additionaly, if the user opens Dev Tools by right-clicking anywhere on the page, then selecting "Inspect" and finally clicking on "Console" in the window that opens, they will be able to see the output of JavaScript code in the console.
